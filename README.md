#AScript

AScript (ArduinoScript, or An AScript) is my attempt to create a custom language that can be converted into assembly for use by the ATmega328P processor. I decided to do this while in CS383 (Computer Organization and Programming), in which we had to learn assembly language for use on an Arduino UNO with an ATmega328P processor.
